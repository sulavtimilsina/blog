This is a capstone project completed in short amount of time. There arent any data availabe for Nepali Sign Language till now.  So I tried to generate small sized data myslef and train various clasifier to accurately detect the hand gestures related to nepali alphabets.

Media Pipe is used for real time hand detection. An image of hand gesture is clipped out from the bounding box of hand which is in-turn fed to the pre-trained model for classification. This is a light project which encompasses training of a claaifier and realtime detection of gestures using computer's web camera.
