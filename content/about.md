Hi, I am Sulav. I recently graduated with Bacheor's in Computer Engineering from [Tribhuvan University, ](https://tribhuvan-university.edu.np/) [Institue of Engineering, ](https://ioe.edu.np)[Paschimanchal Campus](https://www.ioepas.edu.np/), Nepal. My recent research work was on Low Resource Language Modeling and Benchmarking in the Nepali Language.

Currently, I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Palua.AI, Ltd UK](https://palua.ai) where my main focus is on adaptation of Active Learning in various NLP tasks. What if less is more? What if we choose the data in such a way that it almost represents the global distribution of data? So, I am focusing on training a model with fewer data, with an aim of decreasing the data annotation time and resource.

My research interest includes primarily Natural Language Processing and its multimodal applications, Information retrieval, and Active Learning in NLP. Also, I am really excited and passionate about implementing various NLP techniques outside of Computational Linguistics.
