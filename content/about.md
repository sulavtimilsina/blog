Hi, I am Sulav. I recently graduated with Bacheor's in Computer Engineering from [Tribhuvan University, ](https://tribhuvan-university.edu.np/) [Institue of Engineering, ](https://ioe.edu.np)[Paschimanchal Campus](https://www.ioepas.edu.np/), Nepal.  My undergraduate final year dissertation was on building a language model trained on large corpus in Nepali Language. 

I have always been a keen observer of science and technology, mainly focusing on advancements in Artificial Intelligence. Since past few  years, I haven been focusing my self on learning and acquiring skills in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
My research interest includes but not limited to, Natural Language Processing, Active Learning, Computer Vision and Generative Modeling. The linkage between NLP, Computer Vision and other few areas to acquire higher level of understanding of surrounding excites me so much.

Language models are data hungry and requires alot of compute power, so I am focusing on drastically decreasing the amount of data required to train a language model. Currently, I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Palua.AI, Ltd UK](https://palua.ai) where my main focus is on adaptation of Active Learning in various NLP tasks.
