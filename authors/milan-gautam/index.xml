It has got two models: the Generator and the Discriminator are put together into a game of adversary. Through which they learn the intricate details of the target data distribution. These two models are playing a MIN-MAX game where one tries to minimize the loss and the other tries to maximize. While doing so a global optimum is reached, where the Discriminator is no longer able to distinguish between real and generated (fake) data distribution.</description></item></channel></rss>
