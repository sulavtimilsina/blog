It is at its core a transformer language model with a variable number of encoder layers and self-attention heads. Here we are inspired from RoBERTa model which is also based on BERT with 12 encoder layers. It builds on BERT and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence pretraining objective and training with much larger mini-batches and learning rates.</description></item><item><title>Nepali Sign Language Classification</title><link>http://sulavtimilsina.github.io/projects/nsl/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://sulavtimilsina.github.io/projects/nsl/</guid><description>This is a capstone project completed in short amount of time. There arent any data availabe for Nepali Sign Language till now. So I tried to generate small sized data myslef and train various clasifier to accurately detect the hand gestures related to nepali alphabets.
Media Pipe is used for real time hand detection. An image of hand gesture is clipped out from the bounding box of hand which is in-turn fed to the pre-trained model for classification.</description></item></channel></rss>
