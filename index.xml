It has got two models: the Generator and the Discriminator are put together into a game of adversary. Through which they learn the intricate details of the target data distribution. These two models are playing a MIN-MAX game where one tries to minimize the loss and the other tries to maximize. While doing so a global optimum is reached, where the Discriminator is no longer able to distinguish between real and generated (fake) data distribution.</description></item><item><title>Rich Content</title><link>http://sulavtimilsina.github.io/posts/rich-content/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://sulavtimilsina.github.io/posts/rich-content/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hugo ships with several &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes">Built-in Shortcodes&lt;/a> for rich content, along with a &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/">Privacy Config&lt;/a> and a set of Simple Shortcodes that enable static and no-JS versions of various social media embeds.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>http://sulavtimilsina.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://sulavtimilsina.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hi, I an Sulav.
